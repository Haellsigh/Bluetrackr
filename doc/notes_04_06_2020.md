MPU-9250 is not recommended, use ICM-20948 instead.
Inputs only support 1.8V. Need level shifters for every single input (MISO, MOSI, SCLK, CSN, INT), along with another regulator for 1.8V.
Voltage level shifters are made with 2 resistors and a transistor ([see here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bi-directional-logic-level-converter-hookup-guide/all)).
